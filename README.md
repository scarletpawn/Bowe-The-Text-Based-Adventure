# Bowe-The-Text-Based-Adventure
Bowe, before we knew his name. WIP.

A demo. So far, only Act One, Scene One is playable. Currently only compatible with Windows.

Troubleshooting: 
After downloading the zip file, extract it into its own folder with something like WinRAR: http://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0. 
Run by double-clicking the file "RUN". If the demo doesn't work, it might be because JRE isn't installed on your computer: http://java.com/en/download/.
